In our project, there is an Encryption and Decryption, a type of cryptography, refers to the process of scrambling information so that the observer cannot be detecting the data.  Data Encryption helps you to protect the privacy of your email messages, documents and sensitive files. Encryption works with both - text information and files. We just have to select what we want to encrypt, and encryption and decryption helps us keep documents, private information and files in a confidential way. Encryption is also used to ensure the confidentiality of the file and documents from the adversary so that the files and documents remain in a secure way.  Data encryption is also used to provide the security and safety of the files and other important documents from the opponent so that while sending the files or documents nobody else other than the recipient can see it.
